# Project Name
>Bank customer churning <br />

In general, churn is expressed as a degree of customer inactivity or disengagement, observed over a given time. This manifests within the data in various forms such as the recency of account actions or change in the account balance <br />

Aim: <br />
We aim to accomplist the following for this study: <br />
Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn: <br />
Build a prediction model that will perform the following: <br />
Classify if a customer is going to churn or not <br />
Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to  target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn <br />
We will be using ANN models and H2O Auto ML in this project <br />
Time Line of the Project: <br />
Data Analysis <br />
Feature Engineering <br />
Model Building using ANN <br />
Model Building and Prediction using H2O Auto ML <br />
